Decisions.jl is a project to make canonical decision network-backed reprsentations of a wide
variety of decision problems, from the most basic Markov decision processes, to rich and
expressive multi-agent, semi-Markov, multi-objective extensions, to complex problems
unifying decision-, control-, and game-theoretic models.
