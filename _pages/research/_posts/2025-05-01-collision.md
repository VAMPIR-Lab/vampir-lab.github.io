abstract: "Two-vehicle racing is natural example of a com-
petitive dynamic game. As with most dynamic games, there
are many ways in which the underlying solution concept
can be structured, resulting in different equilibrium concepts.
The assumed solution concept influences the behaviors of two
interacting players in racing. For example, blocking behavior
emerges naturally in leader-follower play, but to achieve this
in Nash play the costs would have to be chosen specifically to
trigger this behavior. In this work, we develop a novel model for
competitive two-player vehicle racing, represented as an equi-
librium problem, complete with simplified aerodynamic drag
and drafting effects, as well as position-dependent collision-
avoidance responsibility. We use our model to explore how
different solution concepts affect competitiveness. We develop
a solution for bilevel optimization problems, enabling a large-
scale empirical study comparing bilevel strategies (either as
leader or follower), Nash equilibrium strategy and a single-
player constant velocity baseline. We find the choice of strategies
significantly affects competitive performance and safety."

In this work we develop a novel bilevel optimization approach to handling polytope collision detection problem, and we show that it may offer reliability and computational benefits in scenarios where contact between two polytope primitives are expected and desired.
