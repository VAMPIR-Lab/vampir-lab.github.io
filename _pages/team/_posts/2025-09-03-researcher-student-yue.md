I focus on the intersection of optimization, decision-making under uncertainty, and reinforcement learning frameworks. My work predominately centers around Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)–based Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where I develop and analyze risk-aware decision-making models aimed at improving robustness and reliability in sequential planning under stochastic environments.

In one of my recent collaborative projects, I co-authored a paper with Andrew Cinar (and others) that advances the use of CVaR objectives in MDP settings—which allows decision-making policies to explicitly account for adverse, tail-risk outcomes while optimizing performance. This line of work helps ensure that systems not only perform well on average, but also remain resilient under challenging or extreme scenarios.

I also had the opportunity to collaborate with Andrew Cinar on a project related to computational game theory and trajectory optimization. While my contributions in that space were more focused and supportive, working alongside him provided valuable experience in multilevel optimization and strategic modeling for dynamic systems.

As I continue on this path, my goal is to further strengthen the integration between risk-aware optimization methods and game-theoretic frameworks, contributing novel mathematical tools and algorithms that enhance safety, robustness, and strategic planning in robotics, decision support systems, and other domains where uncertainty plays a critical role.
