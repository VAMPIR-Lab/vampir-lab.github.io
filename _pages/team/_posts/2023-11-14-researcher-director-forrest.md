I am Forrest Laine, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at Vanderbilt University, and the director of the Vanderbilt Mathematical Programming and Intelligent Robotics (VAMPIR) Lab. My research sits at the intersection of computational game theory, optimization, robotics, and healthcare applications, with a strong emphasis on mathematical rigor applied to real-world systems. I received both my PhD and BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley. A central theme of my work is the development of equilibrium-seeking algorithms in dynamic games and trajectory planning. For instance, I introduced the concept of a Generalized Feedback Nash Equilibrium (GFNE) in dynamic games with constraints, along with efficient numerical methods for approximation and trajectory-level computationâ€”especially relevant to autonomous driving contexts. 

In another line of research, I proposed methods for learning mixed strategies in trajectory games, where agents optimize multiple candidate trajectories in tandem during an offline training phase to reduce the computational burden during real-time deployment. Beyond theory, my interests extend into robotics and AI for healthcare, exploring how game-theoretic and control principles can inform interaction models and decision-making strategies in clinical contexts. Leading the VAMPIR Lab, I aim to bridge mathematical programming with intelligent robotic systems, enabling robust, novel approaches to planning and strategic interaction.
