My research focuses on the crossroads of robotics, control systems, and computational game theory. My interest lies in applying rigorous optimization and multilevel game-theoretic frameworks to real-world challenges, particularly in trajectory planning and dynamic interaction modeling in robotics.

One of my recent contributions includes co-authoring “Does bilevel optimization result in more competitive racing behavior?” (2024), where I explored how incorporating bilevel optimization frameworks can yield more strategic and competitive behaviors in simulated racing scenarios. This project showcases the power of hierarchical decision-making models to better reflect complex competitive dynamics in autonomous systems.

In addition, I worked on “Polyhedral Collision Detection via Vertex Enumeration” (2025), presenting a novel mathematical programming approach for collision detection in robotics. Our method leverages vertex enumeration within polyhedral sets to rigorously determine collision boundaries—balancing computational efficiency with safety-critical constraints in dynamic environments.

Earlier, I contributed to QTOS: An Open-Source Quadruped Trajectory Optimization Stack (2023), a practical toolkit aimed at empowering quadruped roboticists with state-of-the-art trajectory generation and optimization tools. This open-source project reflects my commitment to translating theoretical insights into accessible and impactful software solutions for the robotics community.
